# Blue-Light
Hello fellas, this is my third game. I started to learn unity for a while ago. This is a simple Game With Unity, a space shooter where you have to get the highest score.
You can download this game on itch.io : [Blue Light İtch.io Page](https://burakmoody.itch.io/blue-light "Blue Light İtch.io Page")
